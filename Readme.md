# API client/helper for [Snyk API](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/users/user-details/get-user-details)
This is a simple set of library functions that can be used to consume the Snyk API. You don't have to worry about calling the endpoint yourself and thinking if it's a __GET__ request, __PUT__ request, __POST__ request, etc. That is already configured for you behind the scenes.
